# MCP (Model Context Protocol) – Server and Client

## 📌 Introduction
The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a protocol developed by **Anthropic** to standardize how AI models interact with tools, data sources, and applications.  
It defines a common structure for communication between:

- **MCP Server** → Provides tools, resources, and data to the model.  
- **MCP Client** → Connects to the server and makes those tools available to the AI model.  

This setup allows AI models (like Claude) to **use external capabilities in a safe, structured, and scalable way**.

---

## 🔹 MCP Overview
- **Goal**: To make it easy for AI models to access APIs, databases, and other external systems without custom integrations each time.  
- **How it works**:  
  1. The **client** requests capabilities from the **server**.  
  2. The **server** exposes tools/resources it supports.  
  3. The model can call these tools through the client.

## 🖥️ MCP Server
The **MCP Server** is the provider.  
It defines and exposes:
- **Tools** (functions the model can call)  
- **Resources** (datasets, APIs, files, etc.)  
- **Metadata** about available capabilities  

### Example
A server could expose:
- A database query tool  
- A weather API tool  
- Access to a local file system  

When the client connects, it receives a list of these capabilities.

## 📲 MCP Client
The **MCP Client** acts as a **bridge** between the AI model and the server.  
It is responsible for:
- Connecting to an MCP server  
- Discovering available tools/resources  
- Making them accessible to the AI model  

### Example
If the client is connected to:
- A **calendar server** → the model can schedule events.  
- A **search server** → the model can fetch real-time search results.  

---

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Server registers tools/resources**.  
2. **Client connects** to the server and fetches available capabilities.  
3. The **AI model** (e.g., Claude) calls those tools through the client.  

---

## 📚 Benefits
- **Standardization** → One protocol for many integrations.  
- **Safety** → Server defines clear boundaries on what’s accessible.  
- **Extensibility** → Easy to add new tools without changing the model.  
- **Scalability** → Works across many applications and services.  

---

## ✅ Summary
- **MCP** = a protocol for connecting AI models to external tools and data.  
- **MCP Server** = provides tools and resources.  
- **MCP Client** = connects to the server and enables the model to use those tools.  

This architecture enables **powerful, safe, and reusable integrations** for AI systems like Claude.
