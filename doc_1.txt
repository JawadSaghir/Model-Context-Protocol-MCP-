Understanding FastAPI, REST, and RESTful APIs

1. FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern Python web framework for building APIs quickly and efficiently. 
It helps you define endpoints (like /users, /blogs) and handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

2. REST
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing APIs.
It uses HTTP methods, stateless communication, and resource-based URLs.

3. RESTful API
A RESTful API is an API that follows REST principles.
For example:
- GET /users → Retrieve all users
- POST /users → Create a new user
- GET /users/1 → Get user with ID 1
- DELETE /users/1 → Delete user with ID 1

In short: FastAPI builds APIs. If they follow REST rules, they are called RESTful APIs.
